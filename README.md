### Project structure

Here's a brief explanation of what each file and directory does:

    your_library/: This is the root directory for your project.
    your_library/your_library/: This is the directory that will contain your library code.
    your_library/your_library/__init__.py: This file initializes the your_library package.
    your_library/your_library/your_module.py: This is a sample module that you can include in your library. Replace it with your own code as needed.
    your_library/tests/: This is the directory that will contain your test code.
    your_library/tests/__init__.py: This file initializes the tests package.
    your_library/tests/test_your_module.py: This is a sample test module that you can include in your library. Replace it with your own tests as needed.
    your_library/setup.py: This file contains information about your library that is used by pip when installing it. You should fill in the details specific to your library.
    your_library/README.md: This file should contain documentation for your library. It's a good idea to include an overview of what your library does, how to use it, and any other important information.
    your_library/LICENSE: This file should contain the license for your library. Choose a license that makes sense for your use case.
